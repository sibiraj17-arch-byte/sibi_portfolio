# Assets Directory

This directory contains all the static assets for the portfolio website:

- `/css`: CSS stylesheets
- `/img`: Images and icons
- `/js`: JavaScript files
- `/vendor`: Third-party libraries and frameworks

All assets are automatically copied to the `dist` directory during the build process.
